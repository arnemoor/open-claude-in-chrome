The official [Claude in Chrome](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/chrome) extension gives Claude Code full browser automation — as long as you stay within Anthropic's allowlist of "safe" sites. Open Claude in Chrome is a clean-room reimplementation that strips the restrictions while exposing the same 22-tool surface as the official extension and matching its performance.

## What's Different

| | Claude in Chrome | Open Claude in Chrome |
|---|---|---|
| **Domain blocklist** | 58 blocked domains across 11 categories | No blocklist. Navigate anywhere. |
| **Browser support** | Chrome and Edge only | Any Chromium browser (Chrome, Edge, Brave, Arc, Opera, Vivaldi, etc.) |
| **Source code** | Closed source | Open source (MIT) |
| **Tools** | 22 MCP tools | Same 22-tool surface (a few advanced tools are stubs, see below) |
| **Performance** | Baseline | Identical |

### Blocked Domains in the Official Extension

| Category | Blocked Sites |
|----------|--------------|
| Banking | Chase, BofA, Wells Fargo, Citibank |
| Investing/Brokerage | Schwab, Fidelity, Robinhood, E-Trade, Wealthfront, Betterment |
| Payments/Transfers | PayPal, Venmo, Cash App, Zelle, Stripe, Square, Wise, Western Union, MoneyGram, Adyen, Checkout.com |
| BNPL | Klarna, Affirm, Afterpay |
| Neobanks/Fintech | SoFi, Chime, Mercury, Brex, Ramp |
| Crypto | Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, MetaMask |
| Gambling | DraftKings, FanDuel, Bet365, Bovada, PokerStars, BetMGM, Caesars |
| Dating | Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, Match, OKCupid |
| Adult | Pornhub, XVideos, XNXX |
| News/Media | NYT, WSJ, Barron's, MarketWatch, Bloomberg, Reuters, Economist, Wired, Vogue |
| Social Media | Reddit |

Open Claude in Chrome has **none of these restrictions**.

## Architecture

```
Claude Code <--stdio MCP--> mcp-server.js <--TCP--> native-host.js <--native messaging--> Extension <--> Browser
```

Three components:
1. **Extension** — Manifest V3 with CDP-based browser automation (all 22 tools)
2. **MCP Server** — Node.js process started by Claude Code, exposes tools via MCP
3. **Native Messaging Host** — Bridge between the MCP server and the extension

The MCP server and native host authenticate to each other over the loopback TCP channel with a shared secret at `~/.config/open-claude-in-chrome/token` (created automatically on first run, mode `0600`). This stops any other local process, or another user on a shared machine, from driving your browser through the port.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v18+
- **Any Chromium browser** (Chrome, Edge, Brave, Arc, Opera, Vivaldi, etc.)
- **Claude Code** v2.0.73+

### Step 1: Install dependencies

```bash
cd host
npm install
cd ..
```

### Step 2: Load the extension

1. Go to `chrome://extensions` (or `brave://extensions` / `edge://extensions`)
2. Enable **Developer mode**
3. Click **Load unpacked** and select the `extension/` directory
4. Copy the **extension ID** shown under the extension name

### Step 3: Register native messaging

```bash
./install.sh <your-extension-id>
```

If you use multiple browsers, pass all IDs:

```bash
./install.sh <chrome-id> <brave-id> <arc-id>
```

### Step 4: Restart your browser

Close **all** windows and reopen. The browser reads native messaging host configs on startup.

### Step 5: Add to Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add open-claude-in-chrome -- node /absolute/path/to/host/mcp-server.js
```

Find the absolute path with:

```bash
echo "node $(pwd)/host/mcp-server.js"
```

## Verification

Start a new Claude Code session and test:

```
Navigate to reddit.com and take a screenshot
```

Reddit loads. No domain restriction.

## Available Tools

The full 22-tool surface of the official Claude in Chrome. Most are fully implemented. A few advanced tools that depend on Anthropic-proprietary or multi-browser infrastructure are honest stubs — they return a clear "not supported" message rather than fake success.

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `tabs_context_mcp` | Get tab group context |
| `tabs_create_mcp` | Create new tab |
| `tabs_close_mcp` | Close a tab in the group |
| `navigate` | Navigate to URL, back, forward |
| `computer` | Mouse, keyboard, screenshots (13 actions; `save_to_disk` writes to Downloads) |
| `browser_batch` | Run a sequence of tool calls in one round trip |
| `read_page` | Accessibility tree with element refs |
| `get_page_text` | Extract article/main text |
| `find` | Find elements by text/attributes |
| `form_input` | Set form values by ref |
| `javascript_tool` | Execute JS in page context |
| `read_console_messages` | Console output (filtered) |
| `read_network_requests` | Network activity |
| `resize_window` | Resize browser window |
| `file_upload` | Upload local files to a file input by ref |
| `upload_image` | Upload a captured screenshot to a file input (best-effort) |
| `gif_creator` | GIF recording (stub) |
| `shortcuts_list` | List shortcuts (stub) |
| `shortcuts_execute` | Run shortcut (stub) |
| `switch_browser` | Switch browser (stub) |
| `list_connected_browsers` | List connected browsers (stub) |
| `select_browser` | Select browser by deviceId (stub) |

## Updating After Code Changes

No build step. All files are plain JavaScript. After pulling or editing code:

| What changed | What to do |
|---|---|
| `extension/background.js` or `extension/content.js` or `extension/manifest.json` | Reload the extension: `brave://extensions` > click the reload icon |
| `host/mcp-server.js` | Kill stale servers and reconnect: `pkill -f "node.*mcp-server"` then `/mcp` in Claude Code |
| `host/native-host.js` | Restart the browser (close all windows, reopen) |
| `install.sh` or native host name changed | Re-run `./install.sh <extension-id>`, restart browser, re-add MCP |

> The MCP server and native host share an auth token, so after changing either `host/native-host.js` or `host/mcp-server.js` refresh **both** sides (restart the browser **and** `pkill` + `/mcp`). A new server talking to an old native host will refuse the connection. Reloading the extension also picks up any new manifest permission (for example `downloads`, used by `save_to_disk`).

### Quick reset (nuclear option)

If things are broken and you're not sure why:

```bash
# 1. Kill all MCP servers
pkill -f "node.*mcp-server"

# 2. Re-run install
./install.sh <your-extension-id>

# 3. Restart browser (close all windows, reopen)

# 4. Reload extension in brave://extensions

# 5. Reconnect in Claude Code
# /mcp
```

## Multiple Sessions

Multiple Claude Code sessions can share the same browser extension. The first session becomes the "primary" (owns the TCP port), and later sessions connect as clients through it. All can use the browser simultaneously. If the primary session ends, a surviving session promotes itself to primary automatically, so the others keep working without a manual restart.

## Troubleshooting

### Extension not connecting

1. Verify the extension is loaded and enabled
2. Check that `./install.sh` was run with the correct extension ID
3. Restart the browser completely (all windows)
4. Verify the native messaging host manifest exists:
   - **Chrome (macOS)**: `~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/NativeMessagingHosts/com.anthropic.open_claude_in_chrome.json`
   - **Brave (macOS)**: `~/Library/Application Support/BraveSoftware/Brave-Browser/NativeMessagingHosts/com.anthropic.open_claude_in_chrome.json`
   - **Edge (macOS)**: `~/Library/Application Support/Microsoft Edge/NativeMessagingHosts/com.anthropic.open_claude_in_chrome.json`

### MCP server not found

Use an absolute path:
```bash
claude mcp add open-claude-in-chrome -- node /absolute/path/to/host/mcp-server.js
```

### "Browser extension is not connected"

The MCP server is running but no native host is attached. Check, in order:
1. **Is the browser running?** The extension and its native host only exist while the browser is open — no browser means no connection.
2. Open any webpage to wake the service worker.
3. Reload the extension in `chrome://extensions` — a fresh service worker reconnects the native host to the running server.
4. Check service worker logs: `chrome://extensions` > "Inspect views: service worker".
5. Verify `host/native-host-wrapper.sh` exists and its `node` path is valid.

### Tools fail immediately after reconnect

Stale MCP server processes from previous sessions may be holding the port. Fix:

```bash
pkill -f "node.*mcp-server"
```

Then `/mcp` in Claude Code to reconnect. The fresh server will bind the port and accept the native host connection.

### Port conflict

Default port is 18765. To change:
1. Create `~/.config/open-claude-in-chrome/config.json`:
   ```json
   { "port": 19000 }
   ```
2. Restart browser and Claude Code
